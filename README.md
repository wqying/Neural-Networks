# Deep Learning and Neural Networks

This repository is to keep track of my learning progess in the Deep Learning A-Z 2024: Neural Networks Udemy course.
It will include code that I wrote (or will write) for building machine learning models to solve real-world business problems.

### Skills: Python, ML, DL, Tensorflow, ANN, CNN, RNN, Boltzmann Machines, AutoEncoders


More detailed description to come as I advance in the course.
